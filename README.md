# Payroll

*Copy code into a C++ compiler to run*

This is a project I worked on in preparation for graduate school. The purpose was to learn how to implement and use linked lists in C++, as well as using sorting algorithms to organize large amounts of data more efficiently. It is a simple payroll calculator designed to output the employee paychecks in ascending order. The program pulls information from a local file containing the employee name, ID and hourly 
pay, and another file containing the total hours worked by certain employees. The system information is 
processed internally using linked lists.
